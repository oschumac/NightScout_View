NightScout_View is designed as an Visualisation.
It works direktly on the MongoDB and don't need AZURE.
My intension was to get an APP which runs the hole time.
Also when the telephone sleeps to get always an relyable Alarm.
And its designed to be fast also when internet ist not.

Features
- Direkt MongoDB connect so it works also properly on a poor internet connection
- Bloodsugar values chart in 0-24h or overnight 12-12. double click left bottom corner.
- Wipe the screen left to right to see older data curves.
- Vibration Alarm.
- The thresholds of the alarmvalues can be extendet with the direction.
  So you can get an Alarm befor the low or high sugarvalue is there.
- The app uses an internal SQL Database so the Data gets only one time throught the internet.
